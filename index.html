    <h2><u>Notes:</u></h2>
    <p>This web page was designed to enable researchers interested in using the Real-World Free-Operant app to
        easily edit the main setup file (named settings.js).</p>

    <h3>About the app:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The app was first published by Gera et al. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/kgqun/" target="_blank">See the
                preprint</a>.</li>
        <li>The application is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), which means it functions similarly to a
            regular app. However, it offers the benefits of bypassing the app stores and provides the convenience of
            easily creating and installing multiple instances .</li>
        <li> <a href="https://ranigera.github.io/RWFO_app_demo/" target="_blank">See a demo of the app.</a></li>
        <li>The app can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ranigera/HabitApp" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Download the RWFO_app_V2 folder from the repository. The file formed here was designed to be integrated with
            a new version (V2.0) we created. This version is enriched with more
            functionalities to potentially accommodate a large variety of potential research questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>About creating the settings.js file:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The parameters below are pre-set to match the parameters used in the original study.</li>
        <li>You can set them as you see fit.</li>
        <li>Once you finish, click on the "Create the settings.js file" button below and replace the existing
            settings.js
            (in the app main folder).</li>
        <li>See notes regarding each parameter.</li>
        <li>Note that some parameters are contingent on others (this will be clearly
            indicated). You can ignore parameter values that other parameters make them unused.</li>
        <li>Important: while we created this page to accommodate the tuning of many parameters, more parameters can be
            edited manually in the settings.js file (it is structured like a json file).</li>
        <li>We strongly encourage researchers to run some tests after setting the parameter file (this is a new version
            and we
            couldn't exhaustively test all
            the variable/parameter combinations).</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, interested in other functionalities or wish to collaborate, please
            <a href="mailto:ranigera.aristo@gmail.com">contact us</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using more than one instance of the app (multiple contexts):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is possible to use more than one instance of the app, to include for example different stimuli/contexts
            with different conditions.</li>
        <li>To set it up, for each desired instance of the app:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Download the app again.</li>
            <li>Generate a settings.js file with the desired parameters.</li>
            <li>Make sure you choose a different app name in the "App/context name" below.</li>
            <li>Replace the icon images (in the icons folder) and the background.jpg image (in the images folder) of
                your choice to form a new appearance (context) for the app.</li>
            <li>We recommend providing each participant with links that are mapped to the same participant ID for every
                instance of the app. </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
