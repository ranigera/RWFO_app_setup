## Real-World Free-Operant (RWFO) app (V2.0) Configuration - website repo

### General:
This repository is used to create a web page that was designed to enable researchers interested in using the Real-World Free-Operant app to easily edit the main setup file (named `settings.js`).

### About the app:
- The app was first published by Gera et al. [See the preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/kgqun/).
- [See a demo of the app](https://ranigera.github.io/RWFO_app_demo/).
- The app can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ranigera/HabitApp). Download the RWFO_app_V2 folder from the repository. The file formed here was designed to be integrated with a new version (V2.0) we created. This version is enriched with more functionalities to potentially accommodate a large variety of potential research questions.
